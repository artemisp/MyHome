# MyHome

This chrome extension replaces the new tab page with a page that allow users to log in and access their saved widgets.

When new tab clicks, MyHome appears. 
If not logged in, it shows the time, an empty todo, an empty notes page, and the weather.

In the upper right corner there will be a button which will redirect to login. Next to it there will be a sign out button. —> Users that login will be able to save their todo and notes lists across devices by logging in (authentication, database-MongoDB)
