# MyHome

This chrome extension replaces the new tab page with a page that allow users to log in and access their saved widgets.

When new tab clicks, MyHome appears. 
If not logged in, it shows the time, an empty todo, an empty notepad, and the most visited links.
The user can log in to save data on these widgets, choose which of these widgets to display, as well as change the background.

In the upper right corner there will be a button which will redirect to login. Users that login will be able to save their todo and notes lists across devices by logging in (authentication, database-MongoDB).
